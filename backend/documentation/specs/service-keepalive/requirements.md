# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a service keepalive system to prevent the Render free tier service from spinning down due to inactivity. The solution includes a health API endpoint that can be pinged regularly and a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically hits this endpoint every 2 minutes to maintain service activity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Render's free tier, I want a health API endpoint, so that I can programmatically check if my service is running and keep it active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/health` THEN the system SHALL respond with HTTP status 200
2. WHEN the health endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL return a JSON response containing service status and timestamp
3. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL NOT require authentication
4. WHEN the health endpoint responds THEN the response time SHALL be minimal (under 100ms)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated GitHub Actions workflow, so that my service stays active without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN it SHALL make an HTTP GET request to the health endpoint
2. WHEN the workflow executes THEN it SHALL run every 2 minutes automatically
3. WHEN the health check request fails THEN the workflow SHALL log the error but continue running
4. WHEN the workflow runs THEN it SHALL use the production service URL from repository secrets
5. IF the health check succeeds THEN the workflow SHALL log a success message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the health endpoint to be lightweight, so that it doesn't consume unnecessary resources while keeping the service active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health endpoint is implemented THEN it SHALL NOT perform database operations
2. WHEN the health endpoint responds THEN it SHALL use minimal CPU and memory resources
3. WHEN multiple health checks occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently
4. WHEN the health endpoint is accessed THEN it SHALL NOT interfere with other API operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable workflow timing, so that I can adjust the ping frequency if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow is configured THEN the schedule SHALL be easily modifiable
2. WHEN the workflow runs THEN it SHALL respect GitHub Actions rate limits
3. IF the service URL changes THEN it SHALL be updatable via repository secrets
4. WHEN the workflow is disabled THEN the service SHALL still function normally
