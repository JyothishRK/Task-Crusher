# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create health API endpoint


  - Create new router file for health endpoint with GET /health route
  - Implement lightweight response with status, timestamp, uptime, and service name
  - Ensure response time is under 100ms with no database operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Integrate health endpoint into Express application


  - Add health router to main Express app in index.js
  - Ensure health endpoint works with existing CORS middleware
  - Test that health endpoint is accessible at /health path
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Create GitHub Actions workflow file


  - Create .github/workflows/keepalive.yml with cron schedule for every 2 minutes
  - Configure workflow to make HTTP GET request to health endpoint
  - Use repository secrets for production service URL configuration
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 4. Implement error handling and logging in workflow


  - Add error handling for failed HTTP requests in GitHub Actions
  - Log success and failure messages appropriately
  - Ensure workflow continues running even after failures
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.5_

- [x] 5. Add basic tests for health endpoint


  - Write unit tests to verify health endpoint response format
  - Test that endpoint returns 200 status code and correct JSON structure
  - Verify response time requirements are met
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [x] 6. Configure workflow environment and secrets



  - Document required repository secret (SERVICE_URL) setup
  - Add fallback URL handling for development/testing
  - Test workflow execution with proper environment configuration
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.1, 4.3_
