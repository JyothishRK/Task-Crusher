# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user activity logging system for the to-do application. The system will track user-level actions such as task completions, modifications, and errors, providing structured logging capabilities for analytics, debugging, and audit purposes. The logging system will use MongoDB with Mongoose for data persistence and provide a reusable interface for consistent activity tracking across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to track all user actions in the to-do app, so that I can monitor user behavior and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs any trackable action THEN the system SHALL store the activity data in a UserActivity collection
2. WHEN storing activity data THEN the system SHALL include userId, action type, timestamp, and human-readable message
3. WHEN querying activity logs THEN the system SHALL support efficient lookups by userId, action type, and timestamp
4. WHEN an action involves a specific task THEN the system SHALL optionally include the taskId in the activity log

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable logging function, so that I can consistently log user activities throughout the application without duplicating code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling the logging function THEN the system SHALL accept userId, action, taskId (optional), and error (optional) parameters
2. WHEN building the log message THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a human-readable summary from the provided parameters
3. WHEN logging successful actions THEN the system SHALL store the activity without error information
4. WHEN logging failed actions THEN the system SHALL include error details in the activity record
5. WHEN the logging function is called THEN the system SHALL handle both success and error scenarios in the same interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want structured activity data with proper indexing, so that I can efficiently query and analyze user behavior patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the schema THEN the system SHALL create indexes on userId and timestamp fields for query optimization
2. WHEN storing activity records THEN the system SHALL use ObjectId type for userId and taskId fields
3. WHEN creating the schema THEN the system SHALL disable version keys to reduce document size
4. WHEN querying by multiple criteria THEN the system SHALL support compound queries on userId, action, and timestamp efficiently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error tracking in activity logs, so that I can identify and resolve issues that users encounter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during user actions THEN the system SHALL capture the error message in the activity log
2. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL maintain the same data structure as successful actions
3. WHEN storing error information THEN the system SHALL make the error field optional to support both success and failure scenarios
4. WHEN reviewing logs THEN the system SHALL provide clear distinction between successful actions and errors through the presence of error data
