# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the security vulnerability in the current authentication system where JWT tokens are exposed in API response bodies. The current implementation sends tokens directly in JSON responses during signup and login, making them accessible to JavaScript and vulnerable to XSS attacks. This feature will implement secure token handling using HTTP-only cookies with additional security measures to protect user authentication tokens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want authentication tokens to be stored securely in HTTP-only cookies, so that they cannot be accessed by client-side JavaScript and are protected from XSS attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully signs up THEN the system SHALL set the JWT token in an HTTP-only cookie instead of returning it in the response body
2. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL set the JWT token in an HTTP-only cookie instead of returning it in the response body
3. WHEN setting authentication cookies THEN the system SHALL configure them with the Secure flag for HTTPS connections
4. WHEN setting authentication cookies THEN the system SHALL configure them with the SameSite attribute set to 'Strict' or 'Lax'
5. WHEN setting authentication cookies THEN the system SHALL set an appropriate expiration time that matches the JWT token expiration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication to work seamlessly with the new cookie-based approach, so that I can continue using the application without any disruption to the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication middleware processes a request THEN it SHALL read the JWT token from the HTTP-only cookie instead of the Authorization header
2. WHEN the authentication middleware processes a request THEN it SHALL fall back to reading from the Authorization header if no cookie is present (for backward compatibility)
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear the authentication cookie by setting it to expire immediately
4. WHEN a user logs out from all devices THEN the system SHALL clear the authentication cookie and invalidate all stored tokens

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API responses to be clean and not expose sensitive information, so that the application follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up successfully THEN the response SHALL contain only user information without the token
2. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the response SHALL contain only user information without the token
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL not set any authentication cookies
4. WHEN the system encounters an error during token generation THEN it SHALL not expose token-related error details in the response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication system to be configurable for different environments, so that I can adjust security settings based on deployment context (development vs production).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read cookie security settings from environment variables
2. IF the application is running in production THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS-only cookies
3. IF the application is running in development THEN the system SHALL allow HTTP cookies for local testing
4. WHEN configuring cookie settings THEN the system SHALL use secure defaults if environment variables are not specified

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want clear documentation on how authentication works with cookies, so that I can update the client-side code to work with the new authentication flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the cookie-based authentication THEN the system SHALL maintain API endpoint compatibility
2. WHEN a request is made with valid authentication THEN the user information SHALL be available in the same format as before
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the error responses SHALL maintain the same format and status codes
4. WHEN implementing the new system THEN existing API contracts SHALL remain unchanged except for token handling
