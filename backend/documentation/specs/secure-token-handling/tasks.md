  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.5, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Update logout routes to clear authentication cookies



  - Modify POST /users/logout route to clear authentication cookie
  - Modify POST /users/logoutall route to clear authentication cookie

  - Write integration tests for logout cookie clearing
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 7. Update CORS configuration for cookie support


  - Configure Express CORS to support credentials for cookie transmission
  - Update Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header handling
  - Test cross-origin cookie transmission

  - Test authentication failure scenarios with no cookies set
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 10. Write security-focused tests

  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_



- [x] 11. Update all protected routes to work with cookie authentication


  - Test all existing protected routes (tasks, user profile, etc.) with cookie auth
  - Verify that all routes properly authenticate using the updated middleware
  - Fix any routes that may have custom authentication logic
